Issue Tracking
===================================

We use `github issues`_.

.. _github issues: https://github.com/prithvijitguha/MyView/issues

You can filter to labels that would like working with more.

To self assign any issue to yourself you can comment ``take`` under any issue.

This will automatically assign issue to you.

If the issue is assigned to someone else you can check with them and colloborate.
